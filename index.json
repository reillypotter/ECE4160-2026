I connected to the Artemis board using a USB cable to where I then selected the board through the Arduino IDE and tested various examples from the IDE.\nBlink # The Artemis board flashes a blue LED every second.\nBlink test Serial # Here we can see the Artemis recieves the string and echos it back Serial output test analogRead Temperature Sensor # As I hold the board, the temperature increases from consistent 33100 readings to 33300 readings.\nTemperature sensor test Microphone Output # You can see the values of ambient noise and then a jump in frequency as I provide sound.\nMicrophone test 1b # Codebase and BLE # Bluetooth Low Energy is used for the connection between my latop and Artemis board.\nBLE radio acts like a community bulletin board where computers act ascommunity members and can connect to read the board. If the radio is a bulletin board, it\u0026rsquo;s called a peripheral device. The Artemis scts as the bulletin board and is responsible for posting data. If the radio is a reader it reads from any of the bulletin boards.\nA peripheral provides services, which in turn provides characteristics. Services are identified by unique numbers known as UUIDs. Bluetooth acts on mulitple layers, and the General Attribute Profile (GATT) is what defines services and characteristics.\nThe codebase has various Python and Arduino packages along with code files to help establish a Bluetooth connection with the Artemis board.\nImportant functions used to communicate between the computer and Artemis: send_command(cmd_type, data) to send a command ble.connect() and ble.disconnect to connect with the Artemis receive_string(uuid) to recieve a string from our board start_notify(uuid, notification_handler) to activate the notification handler Configurations and Setup # I installed venv: python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv\nI created the \u0026ldquo;FastRobots_ble\u0026rdquo; virtual environment: python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble\nI activated the virtual environment: source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate\nI downloaded python packages: pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio bleak jupyterlab and the provided ble_robot_1.4 codebase into my project directory\nThen I started the Jupyter server: jupyter lab\nI updated the Artemis MAC Address in connections.yaml using the provided one: artemis_address: 'C0:C2:8A:89:98:08'\nI generated a new UUID: run from uuid import uuid4 and uuid4().

GET_ARRAY was also changed to GET_ARRAYS to add in the new temperature array.\nArduino Code:\ncase GET_ARRAYS: int i; for (i = 0; i \u0026lt; TIME_SAMPLES; i++) { time_array[i] = (int) millis(); temp_array[i] = (int) getTempDegF(); } Serial.print(i); Serial.println(\u0026#34; time samples received.\u0026#34;); break; case GET_TEMP_READINGS: for (i = 0; i \u0026lt; TIME_SAMPLES; i++) { tx_estring_value.clear(); tx_estring_value.append(\u0026#34;Temp: \u0026#34;); tx_estring_value.append(temp_array[i]); tx_estring_value.append(\u0026#34; at time:\u0026#34;); tx_estring_value.append(time_array[i]); tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str()); } Serial.print(\u0026#34;Sent back: \u0026#34;); Serial.print(i); Serial.println(\u0026#34; messages.\u0026#34;); break; Jupyter Code:\nble.start_notify(ble.uuid[\u0026#39;RX_STRING\u0026#39;], notification_handler) ble.send_command(CMD.GET_ARRAYS, \u0026#34;array\u0026#34;) ble.send_command(CMD.GET_TEMP_READINGS, \u0026#34;temp\u0026#34;) Temp and Time Arrays Output Task 8 # Task 5\u0026rsquo;s method is clearly slower than Task 6\u0026rsquo;s as Task 5 requires the Artemis to send its data to the computer after every measurement before it can record again. Task 6 is able to record all the data at once before sending it to the computer, but it does introduce a delay in reception of data. This can mean a slower response time, so it is not as applicable for time sensitive decisions. When not caring about feedback as much, this method can be more useful as the lack of a delay allows for more accurate data over the given amount of time.\nFor Task 6\u0026rsquo;s method the first element is T: 146591ms and the 1000th is T: 146608ms which is equivalent to data being transferred every 0.017ms. This is considerably faster than the time it took in Task 5.\nBoth millis() and getTempDegF() stored as ints with 4 bytes each for a total of 8 bytes. The Arduino IDE shows that global variables use 30648 bytes, so if the Artemis board has 384 kB of RAM, then 353,352 bytes remain allowing us to store a total of 353,352 bytes/8 bytes = 44,169 data points without running out of memory.\nDiscussion # In this lab, I learned about the functions used to communicate to the Artemis over bluetooth and how I\u0026rsquo;m able to modify them. Understanding certain parts of the BLE library like the characteristics was confusing at first, but as I worked through the lab I understood their purpose more. The largest problem I faced during this lab was trying to figure out how to define certain things such as the notification handler or some of my implementations like the arrays. Collaboration # I referenced Lucca\u0026rsquo;s site for inital help developing and formatting my website. I also used ChatGPT to help me figure out some documentation for my site.\n","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/labs/lab1/","section":"Labs","summary":"","title":"Lab 1: The Artemis board and Bluetooth","type":"labs"},{"content":"","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/labs/lab2/","section":"Labs","summary":"","title":"Lab 2: The IMU","type":"labs"},{"content":"","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/labs/","section":"Labs","summary":"","title":"Labs","type":"labs"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ECE4160-2026/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
